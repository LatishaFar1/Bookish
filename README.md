Bookish is built with React and Ruby on Rails.

## Welcome to Bookish 
    This app allows an admin user (using rails' active admin gem) to create, update, and delete books.

    Includes a map (built with the Google API) to locate local Bookish stores.
    
    It also allows you to search books on the site.
